My Python solutions for Project Euler.


## Structure

Solutions are laid out as a single python project/venv as described in [The good way to structure a python project (towardsdatascience.com)][tds-structure].


## Python version

All python solutions use python3, and have been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with python 3.10.
